# Tunify - Music Player

Tunify is a static music player application built using the fundamentals of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The webapp incorporates a predefined music list and other essential features generally included in music player applications. Using JavaScript functions, the functionalities of play/pause, progress-bar, play next/prev have been successfully emulated. To make the appearance more appealing, AOS (Animation on Scroll) Library has been implemented too. For a touch of authenticity, a section depicting authorship has been attached with a brief self-introduction.

The Tunify application in no way represents the grandeurs of a web-application. To the readers and viewers, it is a request to view this application as a mere attempt to exercise the author's understanding of JavaScript and not a competitive portrayal of developmental excellence. 

A more advanced and functionally equipped version of this project will be posted on the Github in the near future.

Thanks!
